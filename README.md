I'm a senior in CS at the University of Oklahoma. I work at the Data Institute for Societal Challenges, where I rotate through the stack; first it was frontend webdev, then proprietary NLP, and now a little bit of performance-critical C++.

I'm also in charge of service management for a project serving the Federal Aviation Administration. Using k3d, I set up Kubernetes deployments to automatically boot each microservice into its own Docker container. Our desktop client reads data packets from nearby vehicles using an antenna that costs thousands, expanding access to small airfields that can't afford the million-dollar SOTA.

Outside of that, I have a whole bunch of Java projects under my belt, extensive research experience doing data analysis in R, and more. If you want to see my full skillset and work history, check out my resume (please I worked so hard on it)
